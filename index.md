## Why I created this app?
Honestly, this was kind of an experiment to see understand how was the process of publishing an iOS app to the App Store. I wanted to start with a simple app (currently working on a more complicated app of my own) and see what problems I may encounter during the submit process. 

## Description

The Boring Counter as the title says, is a simple counter where you keep track of how many people enter or exit a closed space setting a limit capacity. This could be used in several situations especially with COVID-19. It's a bit late to create this kind of app but who knows, maybe somebody needs it at the moment! Also, the source code is here so you can check it out how I did this.

## Features

- Friendly UI that indicates the current state of the allowed capacity with bright colors and a message.
- Straight to the point, no complicated paths to use it.

## Design
This is how it looks
